Just a quick touch into the wonderful world of rendering.

Tried to follow Sebastian Lague's [Software Rasterizer](https://youtu.be/yyJ-hdISgnw?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0ehjAfLFsp1PGaatzAwo0u0K) but got a bit lost :P
I learned a lot about rendering and BMP file export stuff.

To run, open the repo in VS Code or another editor and run ``dotnet run`` (you might need to install dotnet)
